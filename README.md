### What I learned

This project helped me grasp the basics of web development in depth, as I found myself searching up and learning about different ways to center objects and learning several css values to tweak with along the way. I'm excited to see my progress in a few months, to see how far I've come from this project, which I mark my first successfully launched web project!
